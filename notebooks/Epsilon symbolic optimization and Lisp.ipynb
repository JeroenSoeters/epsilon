    "General convex programming frameworks (e.g. CVX) have historically relied on transforming any optimization problem into a canonical cone form and solving them with generic cone solvers. The appeal of this approach is that a large set of convex functions can be written with a small set of atoms (namely, linear functions and cone constraints) allowing them to be solved by robust algorithms (e.g. interior point methods) after a transformation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Epsilon is to address the gap between the flexibility of general convex programming frameworks and the speed and scalability of achievable with specialized algorithms. The key innovations that enable progress toward this goal are 1) considering new problem forms beyond the canonical cone form; which enables 2) a dramatic expansion of the set of atoms that can be used as the \"backend\" for general convex programming. By increasing the set of atoms and problems forms we widen the set of applicable numerical methods far beyond the classical conic solvers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem form we target is inspired by the popularity of operating splitting methods, e.g. the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM); the *sum-of-prox form* which consists of an objective which is the sum of functions with efficient proximal operators. Many functions have efficient proximal operators and indeed the sum-of-prox form can be seen as a generalization of the canonical cone which requires only 3 proximal operators (projection onto the nonnegative, second-order and semidefinite cones).\n",
    "\n",
    "While proximal and epigraph operators provide efficient atomic operations for non-linear functions, the same principle also applies to the implementation of linear functions. In particular, existing general convex solvers require linear functions to be instantiated explicitly using either sparse or dense matrices which can be highly inefficient. For example, explicitly instantiating the Kronecker product (required to handle multiplicaiton with matrix-valued variables) is hugely expensive when the matrix needs to be inverted while other linear operators can resulting poorly conditioned matrices but have highly efficient exact solutions (in this case, using FFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "For both linear and non-linear operators, the challenge in expasnding the set of problem forms and atoms is that it requires a more sophisticated approach to the symbolic manipulation of optimization problems by the compiler frontend. Concretely, there are often many ways to represent a given problem which are all mathematically equivalent but have dramatically different computational properties due to the computational complexity of instantiating different atoms on the backend or the number of iterations required for convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this notebook is *symbolic* representation and manipulation of the optimization problem, i.e. the main function of the Epsilon compiler frontend.   "

    "In order to solve an optimization problem with numerical algorithms, the problem must be written in a particular form which results in instantiating a particular set of *atoms* backed by numerical routines on the backend. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that our use of the word \"atom\" is somewhat different than how it has been used in other convex programming frameworks such as CVXPY and Convex.jl where functions that may be implemented in terms of other functions are still called \"atoms\". However, the original CVX and DCP paper (Grant, 2006) use the word atom in the same way as we intend here: to refer to an atomic function that does not require a different form to be solved by numerical algorithms.)"

    "In general, a programming language that does not support loops is rather weak. Imagine if C had this limitation! \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to support loops in the right way, you would most likely need a new programming language (or you _may_ be able to build it onto of python generators, but this seems tricky). The key limitation is that langauge-level constructs in Python are not available to application code. Essentially, Python does not support Lisp-like macros so the only option is to invent a new construct for a for-loop (e.g. \"for(0, 1, 10, ...)\") which would be so ugly as to completely defeat the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out Julia does support macros but Convex.jl does not handle loops by incorporating them into the problem description problably because 1) there may be minor benefit w/ existing solvers and 2) Julia does not have the same list comprehension idioms as Python (I don't know if this is true or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "In any event, a dedicated language could easily support this by supporting a loop construct in the abstract syntax tree. The syntax for loops would have to be defined but likely this could borrow heavily from the Python version.  "

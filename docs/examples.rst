Examples
========

Examples of using Epsilon to solve various optimization problems, especially
those arising in statistics in machine learning. On :ref:`classic`, Epsilon
rapidly reproduces (near) state-of-the-art results, while :ref:`complex`
demonstrate the expressive power of declarative convex programming in developing
sophisticated models.

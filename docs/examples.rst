Examples
========

Examples of using Epsilon to solve various optimization problems, especially
those arising in statistics in machine learning. On `Classic ML datasets`_, Epsilon
rapidly reproduces (near) state-of-the-art results within the rapid prototyping
environment provided by CXVPY and numerical Python. On `More complex convex
models`_, we demonstrate the expressive power of declarative convex programming
in developing more sophisticated convex models.

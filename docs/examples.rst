Examples
========

Examples of using Epsilon to solve various optimization problems, especially
those arising in statistics in machine learning. On :ref:`classic ML datasets <classic>`, Epsilon
rapidly reproduces (near) state-of-the-art results within the rapid prototyping
environment provided by CXVPY and numerical Python. On :ref:`more complex convex
models <complex>`, we demonstrate the expressive power of declarative convex
programming in developing more sophisticated convex models.
